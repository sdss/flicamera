Configuring a computer to run flicamera
---------------------------------------

The following describes how to set up a computer to run ``flicamera``. Part of the steps are intended to ensure that ``flicamera`` can run as a :ref:`docker container <docker>`. The instructions are meant to set up one of the NUC computers that controls the GFA cameras of the SDSS-V FPS, but it should be general enough for any other user. Adapt the IPs and hostnames accordingly.
